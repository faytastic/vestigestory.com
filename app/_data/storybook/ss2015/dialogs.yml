        -   People say wisdom comes naturally with time. Others believe it is through a vigorous accumulation of worldly knowledge. But I say true wisdom cannot be gained without one thing – an open heart. Now I don’t recall when or where I was conceived but a pair of gentle hands brought me into this world. Delivered from an inferno I was lifted from a furnace and smoothed into a slender glass cylinder. Life was blown into my shell cautiously as if one misstep would shatter the fragile moment.
        -   Unlike other fancier versions of my kind my bodice took on the form of a simple bottle. I was plain – but to my creator "just perfect".
        -   Wisdom is born into every being she smiled. But life’s toil and temptation leads us astray casting the shadow of amnesia over our true purpose. Only by opening the heart to the stories of life can one slowly uncover the truth. I was set free to roam the oceans. Throughout the ages I have travelled near and far thrown back and forth in time filled then emptied then filled again. Just take a look inside – I have a story to tell.

        -   A cold splash woke me with a start. How long did I sleep? The sun’s touch felt genuine and gentle. Basked in its soothing warmth I rocked back and forth back and forth in tune to the rhythm of the waves. Then the rocking stopped. I was back on shore again.
        -   It was then that I spotted her. A lone slender figure with a resolute gaze that searched the horizon clear blue eyes transfixed to the distant future.
        -   An artist of some sort the girl sat near the rocks with a sketchbook in hand. She put her pen down and instead concentrated on the endless stretch of the sky. It was as if she could see through the setting sun and all the secrets that the darkness brings with each nightfall.
        -   A glimmer of sunlight interrupted her maze of thoughts. Distracted by my reflection she became aware of my existence. She studied me from afar then slowly made her way towards me. Cautiously she lifted me from the rocks. Her vexed expression melted into a smile when she saw what I held.

        -   It is never easy to be yourself. How many can claim to have discovered their inner sense of self? How many can answer with clarity when asked the simple question – who are you?
        -   But my identity was clear as day from the time I was born. It was beaten into my existence by Mother. I was a farmer’s daughter brought up by the community set out to live a useful life. My purpose is to contribute to the greater good. When the time comes I will start a family with a young man of similar stature. I will work as hard as my neighbors to fulfill my duties to devote to the community.

        -   This is why I love to observe the sky. It is boundless – it knows no limit. No one has ever seen the edge of its endless blue. The vast canvas is nature’s theatre. At times it is a clear clean slate. At times it morphs into a raging passionate tempest. Birds become its colorful actors performing their playful improv compositions.
        -   Birds are fascinating creatures. I like to imagine them as my friends. On days I toil in the fields they would visit me and tell magical tales of what happens in lands faraway.

        -   It was the last day I would see her. Picked up from the riverside I had served as a humble container of daily necessities to her. Now I would be freed again in the same place I was found. She reached into her pocket and took out a small seed. Placing the seed down on a piece of paper she started to fold. It was her best piece of paper dyed cautiously with pigment made from roses and lavender. With meticulous handiwork the paper was transformed into a crane. Next she wiped me clean and carefully placed the crane inside.
        -   '"Deliver my dreams to a kindred spirit. Live another life in place of me" she said with a smile. Her fingers loosened its grip and the rapid currents of the river embraced me. Then she was gone. To this day I remember the meaning behind her smile. I understood.'

        -   I have been taught that a botanical engineer brings new life to the world. We keep the natural ecosystem from failing. Yet when faced against the boundless power of nature humans can only do so much. This year has not been a good year and growth has been sparse. How did things turn out this way despite careful calculations? I don’t have an answer.
        -   Something glistened in the sun. From afar I made out the shape of a glass bottle. I picked it up brushed off the wet sand and saw that it held a delicately folded paper crane.
