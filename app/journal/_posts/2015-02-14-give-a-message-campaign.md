When was the last time you wrote someone a message? Note that we did not say “type”. Human interaction has been trapped behind the barrier of our monitors. Put down your phone, and send an organic message to someone you care about.

## We are inviting writers, fashionistas, and those with an unique perspective to participate in our Give A Message Campaign.

This is a project that aims to connect individuals, a journey to rediscover the link that exists between ourselves and our peers. Participants will be asked to write a short message that adhere to our Spring Summer 2015 theme of “hope” or “freedom”. One winning message will be embossed on the limited edition of our Premium Origami Tee, which will be sold world wide. Part proceeds will be donated to the Dress For Success organisation, empowering disadvantaged women who seeks economic independence.
